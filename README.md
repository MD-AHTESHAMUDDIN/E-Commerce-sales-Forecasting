# E-Commerce-sales-Forecasting
ABSTRACT 
**In the dynamic landscape of e-commerce, understanding sales trends and predicting future patterns is 
paramount for strategic decision-making and sustained growth. In 2019, a total of $603 billion worth of 
sales were done via e-commerce in the United States compared to 3.17 billion in retail sales in the United 
States. The purpose of this study is a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce sales, leveraging state-of-the
art Machine Learning (ML) models for forecasting. Our exploration encompasses Exploratory Data 
Analysis (EDA), revealing insightful patterns and correlations within the dataset. 
Furthermore, this report employs advanced ML techniques, including Linear Regression, Random Forest 
Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor and sophisticated time-series models such as ARIMA 
(Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). The integration of these 
models aims to capture nuanced temporal patterns and enhance the accuracy of sales predictions. 
The ARIMA and SARIMA models, designed for time-series forecasting, offer a robust framework for 
discerning seasonality and trends inherent in e-commerce sales. The predictive power of these models is 
evaluated through rigorous metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error 
(RMSE). 
The insights gained from this analysis not only facilitate a deeper understanding of historical sales patterns 
but also provide a reliable foundation for forecasting future trends. The amalgamation of ML methodologies 
and time-series forecasting techniques in this study serves as a valuable resource for businesses seeking to 
optimize their operations and anticipate market dynamics in the ever-evolving e-commerce landscape. **
