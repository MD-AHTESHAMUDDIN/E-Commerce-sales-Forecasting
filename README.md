# E-Commerce-sales-Forecasting
**Project Overview**
In the dynamic landscape of e-commerce, understanding sales trends and predicting future patterns is crucial for strategic growth. In 2019, e-commerce sales in the United States totaled $603 billion, compared to $3.17 billion in retail sales. This project comprehensively analyzes e-commerce sales using advanced Machine Learning (ML) models for forecasting.

**Objectives**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Reveal insightful patterns and correlations within the dataset.
Machine Learning Models: Utilize Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Time-Series Models: Implement ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) to capture temporal patterns and improve prediction accuracy.

**Methodology**
1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   
  Identify trends and correlations in e-commerce sales data.
  
2) Machine Learning Techniques:
   
  Linear Regression
  
  Random Forest Regressor
  
  Gradient Boosting Regressor
  
3)Time-Series Forecasting:

ARIMA and SARIMA models to discern seasonality and trends.

**Evaluation Metrics**

Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Results:**

Model Performance

Linear Regression: MAE - 17.45, R² - 0.85

Random Forest: MAE - 2.12, R² - 0.53

Gradient Boosting: MAE - 6.90, R² - 0.55

**Discussion:**

The evaluation metrics indicate that Linear Regression achieved the highest R-squared value, signifying a strong correlation between predicted and actual sales. However, Random Forest exhibited the lowest MAE, implying minimal average prediction error. The choice between these models depends on the specific objectives, with Random Forest preferred for precision and Linear Regression for interpretability
