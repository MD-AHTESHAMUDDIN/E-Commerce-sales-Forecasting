# E-Commerce-sales-Forecasting
**Project Overview**
In the dynamic landscape of e-commerce, understanding sales trends and predicting future patterns is crucial for strategic growth. In 2019, e-commerce sales in the United States totaled $603 billion, compared to $3.17 billion in retail sales. This project comprehensively analyzes e-commerce sales using advanced Machine Learning (ML) models for forecasting.

**Objectives**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Reveal insightful patterns and correlations within the dataset.
Machine Learning Models: Utilize Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Time-Series Models: Implement ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) to capture temporal patterns and improve prediction accuracy.
**Methodology**
